Project Description :
The Lebanon Energy Saver is a functional web application designed to address the significant financial challenges stemming from Lebanon's electricity crisis and the high cost of reliance on private generators.

The application serves as a comprehensive energy audit system, allowing homeowners to accurately calculate the estimated monthly Kilowatt-hour (kWh) consumption and the associated USD cost for various household appliances based on current generator tariffs.

This dynamic tool empowers users by providing clear, data-driven insights, enabling them to make informed decisions to optimize their appliance usage and effectively manage their monthly energy expenditures.

Key Technical Summary:

Technology: Built using ReactJS (frontend).

Functionality: Includes a dynamic calculator page (the core feature) and multiple supporting pages.

Design: Fully responsive and optimized for both mobile and desktop use.
